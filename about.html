            </div>
            <div id="underline-left"></div>
            <p>
                BOBBI JAY was born and raised in a quaint town in the heart of the Freestate, South Africa. 
                His journey into the world of music began innocently enough with RnB and pop tunes blasting through his home speakers, 
                igniting a spark within him that would soon become an inferno of passion.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his early years, BOBBI JAY found himself enrolled in dance classes, a testament to his youthful exuberance and love for music. 
                Though the dance shoes were eventually hung up, his ardor for music only intensified. Growing up amidst the electronic pop revolution of the 2000s, 
                BOBBI JAY's musical palate underwent a transformation, evolving into an insatiable appetite for dance music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspired by luminaries such as Benny Benassi, TiÃ«sto, and the unforgettable Avicii, BOBBI JAY embarked on a journey of musical exploration. 
                Armed with his first Digital Audio Workstation, obtained through rather dubious means, he immersed himself in the world of music production, 
                spending countless hours refining his craft.
            </p>
            <p>
                Under a pseudonym, BOBBI JAY began releasing music during his high school years, quickly garnering attention for his infectious beats and undeniable talent. 
                With each release, he edged closer to his true identity, embracing the darker, more hypnotic sounds that resonated within him.
            </p>
            <p>
                As BOBBI JAY's reputation grew, so too did his opportunities. He found himself at the helm of local nightclubs, commanding dance floors with his electrifying sets. 
                His innate ability to read the crowd and curate unforgettable experiences earned him invitations to showcase his talents at venues across the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                With a knack for setting the stage on fire, BOBBI JAY soon found himself sharing billing with some of the country's most esteemed artists, 
                ensuring that the party started long before the headliners took the stage.

                After the pandemic, BOBBI JAY took a backseat to the club life even after the events industry re-opened. Aside from a few short lived local residencies and club apperances,
                BOBBI JAY has stayed relatively quiet. You can still find BOBBI JAY active in the remix space and often a behind the scenes producer and consultant for his industry peers.
                This is far from the end of BOBBI JAY and he is still ready to tear up and dancefloor he has the privelege of being booked for. If you want to see BOBBI JAY in your local nightclub
